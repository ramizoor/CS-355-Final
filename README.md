# CS 355 Final Project – Recipe App

## GitHub Repository
https://github.com/ramizoor/CS-355-Final

## Project Overview
This full-stack recipe application allows users to register, log in, and create, view, update, and delete recipes. It uses:

- Node.js + Express for the backend
- Handlebars for templating
- Sequelize with SQLite for the database
- Express-session for authentication
- Render for deployment

## Features Completed
- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Session-based login with protected routes
- Recipe creation with title, description, instructions, category, and ingredients
- Full CRUD: Users can edit or delete only their own recipes
- Favorites and commenting system
- User profile page displaying personal recipes and saved favorites
- Flash messages and polished styling
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Dynamic form for adding/removing ingredients
- Line-break preservation in instructions/descriptions

## Remaining Work
- Final code cleanup and additional notes needed
- Deployment to Render
- Small UI polish adjustments (spacing, possible addition of search bar)
- README enhancements and screenshots

## MVP Status
I'm practically finished — the core functionality is all working. I just need to do some final cleanup and optional polish before turning it in.
